# Simplified Action Buttons - Complete ✅

## Changes Summary

Removed **View** and **Edit** quick action buttons from both Grid View and List View, keeping only **Duplicate** and **Delete** for cleaner, more focused interactions.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:
Both Grid and List views had **4 action buttons**:
1. 👁️ **View** (Eye icon) - Quick view in drawer
2. ✏️ **Edit** (Edit3 icon) - Open editor
3. 📋 **Duplicate** (Copy icon) - Clone item
4. 🗑️ **Delete** (Trash2 icon) - Remove item

### After:
Now only **2 action buttons**:
1. 📋 **Duplicate** (Copy icon) - Clone item
2. 🗑️ **Delete** (Trash2 icon) - Remove item

---

## 📍 Locations Updated

### 1. **Grid View** (Lines ~2584-2620)
**Before:** 4 buttons in top-right corner
```tsx
<Eye /> View
<Edit3 /> Edit
<Copy /> Duplicate
<Trash2 /> Delete
```

**After:** 2 buttons in top-right corner
```tsx
<Copy /> Duplicate
<Trash2 /> Delete
```

### 2. **List View** (Lines ~2520-2565)
**Before:** 4 buttons in actions column
```tsx
<Eye /> View
<Edit3 /> Edit
<Copy /> Duplicate
<Trash2 /> Delete
```

**After:** 2 buttons in actions column
```tsx
<Copy /> Duplicate
<Trash2 /> Delete
```

## 💡 Rationale

### Why Remove View and Edit?

1. **Card Click = View**
   - Clicking anywhere on the card already opens quick view
   - Redundant to have separate View button

2. **Quick View Has Edit Button**
   - The drawer that opens has an Edit button
   - No need for direct edit from card

3. **Cleaner Interface**
   - Fewer buttons = less visual clutter
   - Focus on destructive actions (Delete) and useful shortcuts (Duplicate)

4. **Better UX Flow**
   - Click card → View details
   - From details → Edit if needed
   - Direct actions: Duplicate or Delete

## 🎨 Visual Impact

### Grid View:
**Before:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│ 👁️ ✏️ 📋 🗑️    │ ← 4 buttons
│                 │
│   [Item Card]   │
│                 │
└─────────────────┘
```

**After:**
```
┌─────────────────┐
│       📋 🗑️     │ ← 2 buttons (cleaner!)
│                 │
│   [Item Card]   │
│                 │
└─────────────────┘
```

### List View:
**Before:**
```
Name | Type | Rarity | Value | [👁️][✏️][📋][🗑️] ← 4 buttons
```

**After:**
```
Name | Type | Rarity | Value | [📋][🗑️] ← 2 buttons (simpler!)
```

```

### New Flow (After):
```
