### 2. Storage Buckets

#### `language-symbols` Bucket
```javascript
{

  public: true,
  fileSizeLimit: 5242880, // 5MB
  allowedMimeTypes: [
    'image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg',

  ]
}
```

**Purpose**: Store reference images, calligraphy samples, grammar charts  
**Used In**: Media tab → Multi-image uploads

```typescript
// Full implementation with:
- Multi-file upload support
- Progress feedback with toasts
- Auto-save integration
- Error handling
- File validation
- UUID-based naming
- Public URL generation
```

**Location**: `languages-panel.tsx` lines ~3680-3750

**Features**:
- ✅ Validates image files only
- ✅ Requires saved language (prevents orphaned files)
- ✅ Generates unique filenames
- ✅ Uploads to `language-images` bucket
- ✅ Auto-saves to database
- ✅ Shows upload progress
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully

#### Media Tab Gallery Display (NEW)
```typescript
// Responsive image grid with:
- 2-4 column layout (responsive)
- Lazy loading
- Cover image indicator
- Hover actions menu
- Set as cover
- Remove image
- Captions
```

**Location**: `languages-panel.tsx` lines ~3750-3820

**Features**:

- ✅ Lazy loading for performance
- ✅ Cover image badge
- ✅ Action menu (set cover, remove)
- ✅ Auto-save on changes
- ✅ Empty state with instructions
- ✅ Caption display

#### Symbol Upload Handler (EXISTING)
Already implemented in Script tab:
- ✅ Single symbol image upload
- ✅ Uses `language-symbols` bucket
- ✅ Preview in symbol card
- ✅ Auto-save integration

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security Policies

#### Public Read (SELECT)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view language symbols"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'language-symbols');
```
- Anyone can view images (public bucket)
- Enables sharing without authentication

#### Authenticated Write (INSERT)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload language symbols"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'language-symbols' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);
```
- Only logged-in users can upload
- Prevents anonymous spam

#### Owner-Only Modify (UPDATE/DELETE)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their language symbols"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'language-symbols' 
  AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] IN (
    SELECT id::text FROM world_elements 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND category = 'languages'
  )
);
```
- Users can only modify their own language's images
- Folder name checked against language ownership
- Prevents unauthorized deletion

### File Organization
```
language-symbols/
  ├── lang-uuid-1/
  │   ├── abc-123.png
  │   └── def-456.svg
  └── lang-uuid-2/
      └── ghi-789.jpg

language-images/
  ├── lang-uuid-1/
  │   ├── sample-1.jpg
  │   └── chart-1.png
  └── lang-uuid-2/
      └── reference-1.webp
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy cleanup when language deleted
- Clear ownership via folder structure
- Enables bulk operations
- Supports future folder-level permissions
