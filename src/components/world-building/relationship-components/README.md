# Relationship Component Refactoring Plan

## Suggested Component Structure

```
relationship-components/
├── RelationshipCard.tsx
├── RelationshipCanvas.tsx
├── FlowchartView.tsx
├── NetworkView.tsx
├── MatrixView.tsx
├── TimelineView.tsx
├── QuickConnectDialog.tsx
├── RelationshipForm.tsx
├── ConnectionPropertiesPanel.tsx
├── types.ts
├── constants.ts
└── hooks/
    ├── useRelationships.ts
    ├── useCanvas.ts
    └── useRelationshipAnalytics.ts
```

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Better Performance**: Smaller components render more efficiently
2. **Easier Testing**: Individual components can be tested in isolation
3. **Better Code Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and fix issues
5. **Reusability**: Components can be used in other parts of the app

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start with the largest sub-components (Canvas, Forms)
2. Extract shared types and constants
3. Create custom hooks for complex state logic
4. Gradually move smaller components
5. Update imports in the main component
