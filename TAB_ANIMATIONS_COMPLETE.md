## 🎨 Animation Behavior

### When Switching Tabs:
1. **User clicks tab** → Navbar underline animates
2. **Old content disappears** → Instant (handled by Radix)
3. **New content appears with:**
   - Starts at 0% opacity
   - Starts 16px below final position
   - Over 300ms:
     - Opacity: 0% → 100%
     - Position: +16px → 0px
   - Easing: Default (ease-out)

### Timeline:
```
0ms:    Tab clicked, underline starts animating
0ms:    Old content hidden
0ms:    New content starts appearing (opacity: 0%, y: +16px)
150ms:  New content ~50% visible, halfway up
300ms:  New content fully visible (opacity: 100%, y: 0px)
300ms:  Underline animation completes
```

## ⚡ Performance

### Optimizations:
- ✅ **GPU-accelerated**: Uses transform (translateY) and opacity
- ✅ **No layout shifts**: Content area size doesn't change
- ✅ **60fps smooth**: Hardware-accelerated properties
- ✅ **Efficient**: CSS-only, no JavaScript needed
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Doesn't prevent interaction

### Technical Details:
```css
/* What happens under the hood */
@keyframes fade-in {
  from { opacity: 0; }
  to { opacity: 1; }
}

@keyframes slide-in-from-bottom-4 {
  from { transform: translateY(16px); }
  to { transform: translateY(0); }
}

/* Applied together with 300ms duration */
animation: 
  fade-in 300ms ease-out,
  slide-in-from-bottom-4 300ms ease-out;
```

## 🎭 Visual Polish

### Subtle Yet Noticeable:
- **Not too slow**: 300ms is quick enough to feel responsive
- **Not too fast**: Slow enough to be perceived and appreciated
- **Natural motion**: Slide-up feels like content "rising into place"
- **Smooth opacity**: Fade prevents harsh appearance

### Consistent Design Language:
- Navbar underline: 300ms animation
- Tab content: 300ms animation
- Input focus rings: 200ms transitions
- Hover effects: 200ms transitions
- **Result**: Cohesive, polished experience

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### Changes Made:
- Modified all 8 `TabsContent` className attributes
- Added: `animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 duration-300`
- No JavaScript changes needed
- Leverages Tailwind CSS's built-in animation utilities

### Code Pattern:
```tsx
<TabsContent 
  value="basic" 
  className="mt-0 space-y-6 animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 duration-300"
>
  {/* Content */}
</TabsContent>
```

## 💡 Why This Works

### Psychology:
1. **Motion indicates change**: Helps user understand context switched
2. **Gentle entrance**: Reduces cognitive load
3. **Professional feel**: Matches high-quality applications
4. **Spatial consistency**: Upward motion suggests content "arriving"

### Design Principles:
- **Feedback**: Animation confirms action (tab switch)
- **Continuity**: Smooth transition maintains flow
- **Delight**: Small touches that make UX enjoyable
- **Polish**: Separates good from great interfaces

## 🎨 Animation Timings Across UI

| Element | Animation | Duration | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Navbar underline** | scale-x | 300ms | Tab selection feedback |
