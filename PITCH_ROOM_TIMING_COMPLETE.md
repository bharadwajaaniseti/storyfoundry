# Pitch Room Timing & Status Management - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive timing and status management for pitch rooms with automatic updates, visual indicators, and smart filtering.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Auto-Update Status (Database Function)**
- Created `update_pitch_room_status()` SQL function
- Automatically changes `upcoming` → `live` when scheduled time arrives
- Auto-completes rooms after 3 hours of being live
- Can be called manually or via cron job (every 5 minutes recommended)

**File:** `update-pitch-room-status.sql`

### 2. **Time-Based Filtering**
- Non-hosts: Can't see rooms where scheduled time has passed
- Exception: Users who already joined can still see past-time rooms
- Hosts: Always see all their hosted rooms regardless of time
- Smart filtering prevents confusion and clutter

**Logic in:** `src/app/app/pitch-rooms/page.tsx` - `loadData()`

### 3. **Visual Timing Indicators**
Dynamic badges show room status:
- 🔴 **Live Now** - Green badge with pulse animation
- ⏰ **Starting Soon** - Orange badge (within 30 mins before/after)
- ⏱️ **Past Scheduled Time** - Red badge (for hosts to start late rooms)
- 📅 **Upcoming** - Blue badge (normal upcoming rooms)
- ✓ **Ended** - Gray badge (completed/cancelled)

**Function:** `getTimingBadge(room)`

### 4. **API Functions**

#### Helper Functions:
```typescript
isRoomTimePassed(room) // Check if scheduled time passed
getRoomTimingStatus(room) // Get detailed timing status
```

#### Host Control Functions:
```typescript
startPitchRoomSession(roomId) // Change status to 'live'
endPitchRoomSession(roomId) // Change status to 'completed'
updatePitchRoomStatusAuto() // Trigger auto-update function
```

**File:** `src/lib/pitch-rooms.ts`

### 5. **Auto-Refresh**
- Page auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Calls auto-update function on page load
- Ensures users always see current status

## 🎯 Room Lifecycle

```
CREATE ROOM
    ↓
UPCOMING (📅)
    ↓ [30 mins before]
STARTING SOON (⏰)
    ↓ [Host clicks "Start" OR auto-update runs]
LIVE (🔴)
    ↓ [Host clicks "End" OR 3 hours pass]
COMPLETED (✓)
```

## 📋 Usage

### For Hosts:
1. Create room with date/time
2. See timing badges on all your rooms
3. Rooms with "⏱️ Past Scheduled Time" badge need action
4. Click "Manage" → "Start Session" to go live
5. End session when done

### For Participants:
1. Browse upcoming rooms
2. See only future rooms or rooms you've joined
3. "Starting Soon" badge indicates imminent sessions
4. Join rooms before scheduled time

### Database Maintenance:
```sql
-- Run manually to update statuses
SELECT update_pitch_room_status();

-- Or set up cron job (requires pg_cron extension)
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'update-pitch-room-status', 
  '*/5 * * * *', 
  'SELECT update_pitch_room_status()'
);
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Time Comparison Logic:
- Uses JavaScript `Date` for client-side timing
- Combines `scheduled_date` + `scheduled_time` for accurate comparison
- 30-minute window for "Starting Soon" status
- Graceful handling of timezone differences

### Filtering Rules:
```typescript
// Non-hosts see only:
- Future rooms (time hasn't passed)
- OR rooms they've already joined

// Hosts always see:
- All their hosted rooms (any status, any time)
```

### Performance:
- Parallel data loading with `Promise.all()`
- Auto-refresh interval (30s) balances freshness vs load
- Efficient filtering on client-side after fetch
- RPC function for participant counts (bypasses RLS)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start Session Button** - Add to room details page for hosts
2. **End Session Button** - Complete room lifecycle
3. **Notification System** - Alert participants when room goes live
4. **Scheduled Notifications** - Remind users 15 mins before start
5. **Room History** - View completed/past rooms
6. **Analytics** - Track session durations, attendance rates

## 📝 Files Modified

- ✅ `update-pitch-room-status.sql` - Auto-update function
- ✅ `src/lib/pitch-rooms.ts` - API functions (6 new functions)
- ✅ `src/app/app/pitch-rooms/page.tsx` - UI with badges, filtering, auto-refresh

## 🎨 Visual Examples

**Timing Badges:**
- Upcoming: Blue with calendar emoji
- Starting Soon: Orange with clock emoji (animates)
- Live: Green with red dot (pulse animation)
- Past Time: Red with timer emoji
- Ended: Gray with checkmark

All badges are responsive and clearly communicate room status at a glance!

## ✨ Result

Users now have complete visibility into pitch room timing with:
- Clear visual indicators
- Smart filtering based on user role
- Automatic status updates
- Real-time refresh
- Host control over session lifecycle

Perfect foundation for building the room details page and session management features!
