## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Search not working?
- Ensure you're not in an input field when pressing `/`
- Search has 300ms debounce - wait a moment for results
- Check if filters are active (clear with "Clear Filters" button)

### Keyboard shortcuts not responding?
- Check if focus is in an input field (shortcuts don't work while typing)
- Ensure caps lock is off (shortcuts are case-sensitive lowercase)
- Close any open dialogs first (some shortcuts only work in specific contexts)

### Can't select items?
- Enable "Bulk Mode" first (checkbox icon in toolbar)
- Ensure you're not in a filtered view with 0 results
- Try clicking directly on the checkbox, not the item card

### Images not loading?
- Check internet connection
- Images are lazy-loaded (scroll to view)
- Verify Supabase storage bucket permissions
- Check browser console for errors

### Focus not restoring after closing dialog?
- This is a 100ms delay feature - wait briefly
- Ensure the previously focused element still exists
- If element was deleted, focus returns to document body
