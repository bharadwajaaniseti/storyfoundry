# Fullscreen Button Removed

## Issue
The fullscreen button in the screenplay editor was not working properly and caused confusion.

## Solution
Completely removed the fullscreen button and all related functionality from the screenplay editor.

## Changes Made
1. ✅ Removed fullscreen button from the toolbar
2. ✅ Removed `Maximize2` and `Minimize2` icon imports
3. ✅ Removed `isFullscreen` state variable
4. ✅ Removed `toggleFullscreen()` function
5. ✅ Removed fullscreen change event listener
6. ✅ Removed divider before the fullscreen button

## Alternative
Users can still use their browser's native fullscreen mode:
- **Windows/Linux**: Press `F11`
- **Mac**: Press `Ctrl + Cmd + F`

## Files Modified
- ✅ `src/components/screenplay-editor.tsx` - Removed fullscreen functionality

## Note
If fullscreen functionality is needed in the future, it should be implemented using the browser's Fullscreen API with proper error handling and cross-browser compatibility.
