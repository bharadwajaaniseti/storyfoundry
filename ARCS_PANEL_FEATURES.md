### 6. Advanced Filtering & Search
- **Multi-criteria Filtering**:
  - Arc type (Character, Plot, Subplot, etc.)
  - Status (Planned, Active, Completed, etc.)
  - Hierarchy (Main arcs, Sub-arcs, Parent-specific)
  - Tags (with visual tag chips)
- **Flexible Sorting**:
  - Last updated, Name, Type, Status, Priority, Progress
  - Ascending/Descending order toggle
- **Smart Search**: Name, description, themes, and tags search

### 7. Enhanced Form Interface
- **Three-Column Layout**: Organized into Basic Info, Status & Progress, Connections
- **Real-time Validation**: Form validation with disabled submit when invalid
- **Rich Connections Interface**: 
  - Multi-select for characters, locations, chapters
  - Visual feedback for selections
  - Checkbox-based selection with scrollable lists
- **Advanced Milestone Editor**:
  - Beat type selection
  - Character growth tracking
  - Mood and theme per milestone
  - Drag-and-drop ordering (structure ready)

### 8. User Experience Improvements
- **Expandable Cards**: Click to expand for detailed view
- **Sub-arc Creation**: Direct "Add Sub-arc" button on parent arcs
