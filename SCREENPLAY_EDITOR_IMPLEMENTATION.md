# Screenplay Editor Implementation - Full World-Building Edition

## Overview
A **dedicated screenplay editor** with **full world-building capabilities** has been created for projects with the "screenplay" format, mirroring the comprehensive novel editor structure. This provides screenplay writers with the same powerful suite of world-building tools that novel writers enjoy, adapted for screenplay writing.

## Architecture

The screenplay editor follows the exact same architecture as the novel editor:
- **Main Route:** `/screenplays/[id]` (similar to `/novels/[id]`)
- **Sidebar Navigation:** Full access to all world-building panels
- **Project-Specific:** Each screenplay gets its own dedicated workspace

## Files Created

### 1. Main Screenplay Editor Page
**Location:** `src/app/screenplays/[id]/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- **Dedicated Full-Page Editor:** Complete workspace similar to novel editor
- **Collapsible Sidebar:** Access to all world-building tools
- **Project Dashboard:** Overview with scene count, character count, location count
- **All World-Building Panels:**
  - Dashboard - Project statistics and overview
  - Characters - Character development tools
  - Scenes - Screenplay scene management (coming soon)
  - Locations - Setting and location tracking
  - Maps - Visual world representations
  - Research - Reference materials organization
  - Timeline - Event chronology tracking
  - Calendar - Date and season management
  - Arcs - Plot and character development tracking
  - Relationships - Character relationship mapping
  - Encyclopedia - Knowledge base for story facts
  - Magic - Supernatural systems (if applicable)
  - Species - Races and creatures
  - Cultures - Cultural development
  - Items - Props and artifacts
  - Systems - Political/social structures
  - Languages - Language creation
  - Religions - Belief systems
  - Philosophies - Underlying worldviews

### 2. Transition Page (App Route)
**Location:** `src/app/app/screenplays/[id]/page.tsx`

**Purpose:**
- Validates screenplay project
- Checks user permissions
- Redirects to main screenplay editor at `/screenplays/[id]`

### 3. Legacy Screenplay Editor Component
**Location:** `src/components/screenplay-editor.tsx`

**Status:** Replaced by full-page editor
- Original component with basic screenplay formatting
- Kept for reference or future integration into Scenes panel

## Routing Updates

### 1. Project Creation
**File:** `src/app/app/projects/new/page.tsx`

When a screenplay project is created, users are now redirected to:
```typescript
router.push(`/screenplays/${result.project.id}`)
```

### 2. Projects List
**File:** `src/app/app/projects/page.tsx`

Clicking on a screenplay project navigates to:
```typescript
router.push(`/screenplays/${project.id}`)
```

### 3. Search Results
**File:** `src/app/app/search/page.tsx`

Screenplay projects in search results link to:
```typescript
href={`/screenplays/${project.id}`}
```
