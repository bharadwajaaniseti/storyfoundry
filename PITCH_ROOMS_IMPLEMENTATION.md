# Pitch Rooms Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The Pitch Rooms feature allows writers to host and join virtual pitch sessions where they can present their projects to industry professionals and fellow creators.

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… 1. Database Schema (`create-pitch-rooms-schema.sql`)

**Tables Created:**
- `pitch_rooms` - Stores pitch room information (title, description, schedule, host, status)
- `pitch_room_participants` - Tracks who has joined each room
- `pitch_room_pitches` - Stores project pitches submitted to rooms
- `pitch_room_ratings` - Stores feedback and ratings on pitches

**Key Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Automatic participant counting
- Automatic rating calculation for pitches
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Triggers for updating timestamps and ratings

### âœ… 2. API Functions (`src/lib/pitch-rooms.ts`)

**Available Functions:**
- `getUpcomingPitchRooms()` - Fetch all upcoming public rooms with participant counts
- `getMyHostedRooms()` - Get rooms hosted by current user
- `getRoomParticipantCount()` - Get number of participants in a room
- `isUserParticipant()` - Check if user has joined a room
- `createPitchRoom()` - Create a new pitch room
- `joinPitchRoom()` - Join a room as participant
- `leavePitchRoom()` - Leave a room
- `getRoomParticipants()` - Get list of all participants
- `submitPitch()` - Submit a project pitch to a room
- `getRoomPitches()` - Get all pitches in a room
- `getPitchRoomStats()` - Get weekly statistics

### âœ… 3. Updated Pitch Rooms Page (`src/app/app/pitch-rooms/page.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Real-time loading of upcoming pitch rooms
- Display of user's hosted rooms
- Join/Leave functionality with loading states
- Participant count tracking
- Room status indicators (Open/Full)
- Weekly statistics sidebar
- Responsive design
- Error handling with toast notifications

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema

You need to run the SQL schema in your Supabase project:

1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Open the file `create-pitch-rooms-schema.sql`
4. Copy all contents
5. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** to execute all statements

**What this creates:**
- 4 new tables with proper relationships
- RLS policies for security
- Helper functions for counting and ratings
- Triggers for automatic updates

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Run this query in SQL Editor to verify tables were created:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE 'pitch_%';
```

You should see:
- pitch_rooms
- pitch_room_participants  
- pitch_room_pitches
- pitch_room_ratings

### Step 3: Create Test Data (Optional)

To test the feature, create some sample rooms:

```sql
-- Insert a test pitch room
INSERT INTO pitch_rooms (
  title,
  description,
  host_id,
  scheduled_date,
  scheduled_time,
  max_participants,
  status
) VALUES (
  'Sci-Fi & Fantasy Showcase',
  'Present your science fiction and fantasy projects to industry professionals',
  'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE', -- Replace with your actual user ID
  '2025-01-15',
  '2:00 PM PST',
  15,
  'upcoming'
);
```

## Technical Notes

### Database Relationships

```
profiles (users)
   â†“
pitch_rooms (rooms)
   â†“
   â”œâ”€â†’ pitch_room_participants (who joined)
   â”œâ”€â†’ pitch_room_pitches (projects pitched)
   â”‚      â†“
   â”‚   pitch_room_ratings (feedback)
   â””â”€â†’ projects (what's being pitched)
```

### Security

All tables have RLS enabled:
- Users can only see public rooms or rooms they've joined
- Hosts can manage their own rooms
- Participants can view other participants in their rooms
- Only room members can submit pitches and ratings

### Performance

Indexes created on:
- `host_id`, `scheduled_date`, `status` on pitch_rooms
- `room_id`, `user_id` on participants
- `room_id`, `presenter_id` on pitches
- `pitch_id` on ratings

## API Usage Examples

```typescript
// Load upcoming rooms
const rooms = await getUpcomingPitchRooms()

// Create a new room
const room = await createPitchRoom({
  title: 'My Pitch Room',
  description: 'Come pitch your projects!',
  scheduled_date: '2025-01-20',
  scheduled_time: '3:00 PM EST',
  max_participants: 10
})

// Join a room
await joinPitchRoom(roomId)

// Submit a pitch
await submitPitch(roomId, projectId)

// Get stats
const stats = await getPitchRoomStats()
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Cannot read properties of undefined"**
- Make sure database schema is applied
- Check Supabase connection in .env.local

**"Room is full" error**
- Room has reached max_participants limit
- Host can increase limit or user must wait

**RLS Policy errors**
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check that RLS policies were created correctly
- Verify user has proper role/permissions
