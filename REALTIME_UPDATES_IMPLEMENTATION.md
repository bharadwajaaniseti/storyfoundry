# Real-time Updates Implementation

## Overview
Replaced polling-based updates (every 30-60 seconds) with Supabase real-time subscriptions for instant, live updates without page reloads or visible loading states.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Polling Intervals**
**Before**:
- Auto-update every 60 seconds (with full page reload)
- Refresh every 30 seconds (with full page reload)
- Visible loading spinner on every refresh
- Jarring user experience

**After**:
- Supabase real-time subscriptions (instant updates)
- Auto-update reduced to every 2 minutes (just for safety)
- Silent background updates (no loading spinner)
- Smooth, seamless user experience

### 2. **Added Real-time Subscriptions** (`src/app/app/pitch-rooms/page.tsx`)

**Listens to two tables**:
1. `pitch_rooms` - When rooms are created, updated, or deleted
2. `pitch_room_participants` - When users join or leave rooms

**Events monitored**:
- `INSERT` - New room created or new participant joined
- `UPDATE` - Room details changed, status updated, etc.
- `DELETE` - Room deleted or participant left

**Code**:
```typescript
const channel = supabase
  .channel('pitch-rooms-changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'pitch_rooms'
  }, (payload) => {
    loadData(true) // Silent reload
  })
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'pitch_room_participants'
  }, (payload) => {
    loadData(true) // Silent reload
  })
  .subscribe()
```

### 3. **Silent Data Loading**

**Modified `loadData()` function**:
- Added `silent` parameter (default: `false`)
- When `silent = true`: No loading spinner, no error toasts
- When `silent = false`: Shows loading spinner (initial load only)

**Benefits**:
- No flickering or flashing
- Updates happen in background
- User doesn't see loading states
- Data appears instantly

### 4. **Optimized User Actions**

**Join/Leave rooms**:
- Still shows loading state on buttons (good UX feedback)
- Triggers silent reload for immediate update
- Real-time subscription provides backup update
- Double update prevention via debouncing

## How It Works

### Initial Page Load
1. User opens pitch rooms page
2. Shows loading spinner
3. Fetches all data (upcoming, hosted, past rooms)
4. Subscribes to real-time changes
5. Hides loading spinner
6. Ready!

### When Someone Creates a Room
1. Room created in database
2. Supabase broadcasts `INSERT` event
3. Your page receives event instantly
4. Calls `loadData(true)` silently
5. Room appears without reload ✨

### When Someone Joins a Room
1. Participant record inserted
2. Supabase broadcasts `INSERT` on participants table
3. Your page receives event
4. Silently reloads data
5. Participant count updates instantly ✨

### When You Join a Room
1. Click "Join" button
2. Button shows loading state
3. API call completes
4. Silent reload triggered
5. Real-time event also triggers (but debounced)
6. Button state resets
7. Room appears in your list ✨

### When Room Status Updates
1. Auto-update function runs every 2 minutes
2. Updates room status in database
3. Supabase broadcasts `UPDATE` event
4. Your page receives event
5. Silently reloads data
6. Status badge updates (e.g., Upcoming → Live) ✨

## Setup Required

### Enable Real-time in Supabase

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard** → Your Project → Database → Replication

2. **Enable Replication for Tables**:
   ```sql
   -- Enable replication for pitch_rooms table
   ALTER TABLE pitch_rooms REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
   
   -- Enable replication for pitch_room_participants table
   ALTER TABLE pitch_room_participants REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
   ```

3. **Check Replication Settings**:
   - Go to Database → Replication
   - Ensure these tables are listed:
     - ✅ pitch_rooms
     - ✅ pitch_room_participants

4. **Verify RLS Policies Allow Reads**:
   - Real-time subscriptions respect RLS
   - Users must have SELECT permission on tables
   - Our existing RLS policies should work fine

### Alternative: Enable via UI

1. Go to **Database** → **Replication** in Supabase
2. Find `pitch_rooms` table → Click toggle to enable
3. Find `pitch_room_participants` table → Click toggle to enable
4. Done!

## What Updates in Real-time

### Pitch Rooms List
- ✅ New rooms appear instantly
- ✅ Room details update (title, description, etc.)
- ✅ Status changes (Upcoming → Live → Completed)
- ✅ Rooms deleted disappear instantly
- ✅ Cancelled rooms move to past section

### Participant Counts
- ✅ Count updates when someone joins
- ✅ Count updates when someone leaves
- ✅ Your participation status updates
- ✅ Join/Leave buttons update state

### Room Status Badges
- ✅ Timing badges update (Upcoming, Starting Soon, Live, etc.)
- ✅ Status transitions happen smoothly
- ✅ Past-time rooms move to past section

### Your Hosted Rooms
- ✅ Participant list updates
- ✅ Status changes reflect immediately
- ✅ Room moves to past section when completed

## Fallback Mechanism

### Safety Net
Even with real-time enabled, we keep a **2-minute auto-update interval**:
- Catches edge cases where real-time might miss
- Updates status via SQL function
- Very infrequent, so not intrusive
- Provides confidence in data accuracy

### Why Keep It?
- Network issues might interrupt real-time
- Database triggers might not fire in rare cases
- Status auto-updates (live → completed) happen server-side
- Better safe than sorry!

## Testing

### Test Real-time Updates

1. **Open two browser windows** side-by-side
2. **Log in as different users** (or same user, different tabs)
3. **Create a room** in Window 1
4. **Watch Window 2** - Room should appear instantly
5. **Join room** in Window 2
6. **Watch Window 1** - Participant count should update

### Test Status Updates

1. Create a room scheduled for 2 minutes from now
2. Wait and watch
3. After 2 minutes, status should update to "Live"
4. No page reload needed!

### Test Participant Changes

1. Open room in two windows
2. Join in Window 1
3. Watch participant count in Window 2
4. Leave in Window 1
5. Watch count decrease in Window 2

## Console Logs

You'll see logs like:
```
Pitch room changed: {
  eventType: "INSERT",
  new: { id: "...", title: "...", ... },
  old: null
}

Participant changed: {
  eventType: "UPDATE",
  new: { room_id: "...", user_id: "...", ... },
  old: { ... }
}
```

These help with debugging and understanding what's happening.

## Cleanup

When user leaves the page:
```typescript
return () => {
  supabase.removeChannel(channel)  // Unsubscribe from real-time
  clearInterval(updateInterval)     // Clear auto-update timer
}
```

This prevents memory leaks and unnecessary subscriptions.

## Future Enhancements

### Optimistic Updates
Instead of reloading all data, just update the specific room:
```typescript
.on('postgres_changes', { ... }, (payload) => {
  if (payload.eventType === 'UPDATE') {
    setUpcomingRooms(rooms => 
      rooms.map(room => 
        room.id === payload.new.id ? payload.new : room
      )
    )
  }
})
```

### Presence
Show who's viewing a room right now:
```typescript
const presenceChannel = supabase.channel('room:123')
  .on('presence', { event: 'sync' }, () => {
    const state = presenceChannel.presenceState()
    console.log('Users online:', state)
  })
  .subscribe()
```

### Broadcast
Send messages between users without database:
```typescript
channel.on('broadcast', { event: 'cursor' }, (payload) => {
  console.log('Cursor moved:', payload)
})

channel.send({
  type: 'broadcast',
  event: 'cursor',
  payload: { x: 100, y: 200 }
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Real-time Not Working?

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Database → Replication
   - Ensure tables are enabled

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Look for subscription errors
   - Check network tab for WebSocket connection

3. **Check RLS Policies**:
   - Real-time respects RLS
   - Ensure SELECT permission on tables

4. **Verify API Key**:
   - Using correct anon key
   - Not using service role key (doesn't support real-time)

### Updates Delayed?

- Supabase real-time is typically <100ms
- Network latency may add delay
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Supabase region (closer = faster)

### Memory Leaks?

- Ensure cleanup function runs
- Check channel is being removed
- Use React DevTools to monitor subscriptions

## Summary

✨ **Before**: Jarring reloads every 30 seconds
✨ **After**: Seamless real-time updates

The page now feels alive and responsive, updating instantly as changes happen anywhere in the system. Users will love the smooth, modern experience!
