# Encyclopedia Enhanced Features - Testing Guide

## 🎯 **What to Test**

Now that you've installed the database schema and built the application successfully, here's how to test all the new encyclopedia features:

### **1. Basic Encyclopedia Access**
- Navigate to any project in your app
- Click on the **Encyclopedia** tab in the world-building section
- You should see the new enhanced interface with:
  - Sidebar for entries and folders
  - Search bar and filtering options
  - "Add Entry" and folder creation buttons

### **2. Test Folder Organization** 📁
1. **Create a Folder**:
   - Click the folder+ icon next to "Add Entry"
   - Name it something like "Characters" or "Locations"
   - Notice it gets a default blue color

2. **Organize Entries**:
   - Create some encyclopedia entries
   - Assign them to different folders using the folder dropdown
   - Expand/collapse folders to test navigation

3. **Folder Features**:
   - Try different folder colors (if implemented)
   - Test entry count indicators
   - Verify folder expansion state persists

### **3. Test Section-Based Articles** 📄
1. **Create New Article**:
   - Click "Add Entry"
   - You should see the new section-based editor
   - Notice the default template with Summary, Overview, and Stats sections

2. **Section Management**:
   - **Add Sections**: Use the "+ Add Section" dropdown
   - **Reorder**: Drag sections using the handle icon (≡)
   - **Toggle Visibility**: Use the eye icon to show/hide sections
   - **Duplicate**: Use the copy icon to duplicate sections
   - **Delete**: Use the trash icon to remove sections

3. **Section Types**:
   - **Subheader**: Test adding section headers
   - **Paragraph**: Add rich text content
   - **Stats/Table**: Add key-value pairs for structured data
   - **Image**: Test image URLs and captions
   - **Summary Box**: Add quick facts and reference data

### **4. Test Enhanced Filtering** 🔍
1. **Search Functionality**:
   - Type in the search bar
   - Verify it searches across article names, content, and tags
   - Test real-time search results

2. **Multi-Filter System**:
   - Filter by article type (Concept, Person, Place, etc.)
   - Filter by folder
   - Combine type and folder filters
   - Test "All Types" and "No Folder" options

### **5. Test Legacy Compatibility** 🔄
1. **Existing Entries**:
   - If you had old encyclopedia entries, they should still display
   - Edit an old entry - it should convert to the new section format
   - Verify no data is lost during conversion

### **6. Test User Experience** ✨
1. **Interface Elements**:
   - Verify color-coded article types
   - Check responsive design on different screen sizes
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify loading states and empty states

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Create an entry, refresh the page - verify it persists
   - Edit sections, save - verify changes are saved
   - Test folder organization persists

## 🐛 **Common Issues to Check**

### **Database Issues**:
- ❌ If you see "folder_id" errors: The migration didn't run completely
- ❌ If folders don't save: Check RLS policies in Supabase
- ❌ If sections don't work: Verify `sections` column was added to `world_elements`

### **UI Issues**:
- ❌ Drag-and-drop not working: `@hello-pangea/dnd` package issue
- ❌ Icons not showing: Lucide React icons not loading
- ❌ Section editor broken: TypeScript interface mismatch

### **Performance Issues**:
- ⚠️ Slow loading with many entries: Check database indexes
- ⚠️ UI freezing during drag: Too many re-renders

## ✅ **Success Checklist**

- [ ] Can create and organize folders
- [ ] Can create articles with multiple section types
- [ ] Drag-and-drop section reordering works
- [ ] Search and filtering work correctly
- [ ] Section visibility toggling works
- [ ] Data persists after page refresh
- [ ] Old encyclopedia entries still work
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

## 🚨 **If Something Doesn't Work**

1. **Check Browser Console**: Open F12 → Console tab for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Look for failed API requests
3. **Verify Database**: Check if the migration ran successfully in Supabase
4. **Check Logs**: Look at Next.js terminal output for server errors

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

When everything works correctly, you should have:
- A modern, Campfire Writing-inspired encyclopedia interface
- Flexible article creation with drag-and-drop sections
- Organized folder system for better content management
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Backward compatibility with existing data
- Professional-grade knowledge management for worldbuilding

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify the database migration completed successfully
3. Ensure all required packages are installed (`@hello-pangea/dnd`)
4. Test with a simple article first before complex organization
