# Pitch Rooms - Real-time Updates Summary

## What Changed?

### ❌ Before (Polling-based)
- Page reloaded every 30 seconds
- Visible loading spinner on each reload
- Page would flash/flicker
- Felt slow and jarring
- High server load (constant HTTP requests)

### ✅ After (Real-time subscriptions)
- Instant updates via WebSocket
- No visible loading spinners on updates
- Smooth, seamless experience
- Feels native and responsive
- Low server load (only when data changes)

## How It Works Now

1. **Page loads once** - Shows initial loading spinner
2. **Subscribes to changes** - Listens for database events
3. **Updates arrive instantly** - When anything changes
4. **Silent background reload** - No visible loading state
5. **User sees updates** - Smooth appearance of new data

## What Updates in Real-time?

✅ **New rooms** - Appear instantly when created
✅ **Participant counts** - Update when users join/leave
✅ **Room status** - Changes from Upcoming → Live → Completed
✅ **Room edits** - Title, description, time changes
✅ **Deletions** - Rooms disappear when deleted

## Setup Required

### In Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to **Database** → **Replication**
2. Enable replication for:
   - ✅ `pitch_rooms` table
   - ✅ `pitch_room_participants` table

**Or run this SQL**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE pitch_rooms REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
