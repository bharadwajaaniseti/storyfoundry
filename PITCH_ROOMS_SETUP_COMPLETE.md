# ‚úÖ Pitch Rooms - Setup Complete!

## What You Just Did

You successfully applied the Pitch Rooms database schema to your Supabase project! üéâ

## Next Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Add Test Data (Optional but Recommended)

To see the feature in action, add some test pitch rooms:

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
```sql
-- Copy and run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: seed-pitch-rooms-auto.sql
-- This automatically creates 5 test rooms with your user as host
```

**Option B: Manual**
```sql
-- Use seed-pitch-rooms-data.sql
-- Replace 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE' with your actual user ID
-- To get your user ID, run: SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Feature

1. **Go to Pitch Rooms page** in your app: `/app/pitch-rooms`
2. You should see the test rooms listed
3. Try clicking "Join Room" on a room
4. Check "My Hosted Rooms" section to see rooms you created

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Everything Works

**Check the database:**
```sql
-- View all pitch rooms
SELECT * FROM pitch_rooms;

-- View participants
SELECT * FROM pitch_room_participants;

-- Check RLS policies are active
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename LIKE 'pitch_%';
```

## What's Working Now ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ **Browse pitch rooms** - See all upcoming public rooms
- ‚úÖ **Join/Leave rooms** - Participate in pitch sessions
- ‚úÖ **Participant tracking** - See how many people joined
- ‚úÖ **Room status** - Open/Full indicators
- ‚úÖ **Host your own rooms** - Listed in "My Hosted Rooms"
- ‚úÖ **Weekly statistics** - See platform activity
- ‚úÖ **Security** - RLS policies protect all data

## What's Not Built Yet ‚è≥

- ‚è≥ **Create Room UI** - Need modal/form to create new rooms
- ‚è≥ **Room Details Page** - Dedicated page for each room
- ‚è≥ **Pitch Submission** - Submit projects to rooms
- ‚è≥ **Rating System** - Rate and provide feedback on pitches
- ‚è≥ **Real-time Updates** - Live participant count changes
- ‚è≥ **Video Integration** - Video conferencing for presentations

## Database Tables Created

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `pitch_rooms` | Stores pitch room information |
| `pitch_room_participants` | Tracks who joined which rooms |
| `pitch_room_pitches` | Projects pitched in rooms |
| `pitch_room_ratings` | Feedback and ratings on pitches |

## Available API Functions

```typescript
// Import from '@/lib/pitch-rooms'

getUpcomingPitchRooms()      // Get all upcoming rooms
getMyHostedRooms()           // Get rooms you're hosting
joinPitchRoom(roomId)        // Join a room
leavePitchRoom(roomId)       // Leave a room
createPitchRoom({...})       // Create new room
submitPitch(roomId, projectId) // Submit a pitch
getRoomParticipants(roomId)  // Get participant list
getPitchRoomStats()          // Get weekly statistics
```

## Troubleshooting

**No rooms showing up?**
- Run the seed data SQL to create test rooms
- Check console for errors
- Verify you're logged in

**Can't join a room?**
- Make sure you're authenticated
- Check if room is full
- Check browser console for error messages

**Permission errors?**
- RLS policies might be blocking
- Verify you're logged in
- Check Supabase logs in dashboard

## Next Feature to Build

The most important missing piece is the **"Host a Pitch Room"** form. This will let users create new rooms from the UI instead of SQL.

Would you like me to build that next?
