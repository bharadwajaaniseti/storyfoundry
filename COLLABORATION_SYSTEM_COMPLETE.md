# StoryFoundry: Complete Role-Based Collaboration System

## üéØ System Overview

StoryFoundry now features a comprehensive role-based collaboration system that supports multiple roles per user, advanced permission management, and role-specific workflows. The system transforms how writers, editors, translators, producers, and other creatives collaborate on storytelling projects.

## üîê Role & Permission System

### Available Roles
- **Coauthor**: Full writing collaboration, story development
- **Editor**: Content editing, grammar/style improvements, feedback
- **Reviewer**: Content review, quality assessment, ratings
- **Translator**: Language translation, localization
- **Producer**: Project management, timeline, marketing strategy
- **Commenter**: Basic feedback and commenting permissions

### Permission Matrix
```
Role        | Read | Write | Comment | Invite | Owner Actions
------------|------|-------|---------|--------|---------------
Owner       |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ    |   ‚úÖ   |      ‚úÖ
Coauthor    |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ    |   ‚ùå   |      ‚ùå
Editor      |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ    |   ‚ùå   |      ‚ùå
Reviewer    |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ    |   ‚ùå   |      ‚ùå
Translator  |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ    |   ‚ùå   |      ‚ùå
Producer    |  ‚úÖ  |  ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ    |   ‚úÖ   |      ‚ùå

```

### Multiple Role Support
- Users can have **primary role + secondary roles**
- Permissions are merged using **OR logic** (most permissive wins)
- UI displays all roles with badge indicators
- Role-specific tools appear for all assigned roles

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Enhanced collaboration tables
CREATE TABLE project_collaborators (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id uuid REFERENCES projects(id),
  user_id uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
  role collaboration_role_type,
  secondary_roles collaboration_role_type[], -- Multiple role support
  royalty_split decimal(5,2),
  status collaborator_status,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE TABLE collaboration_invitations (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  project_id uuid REFERENCES projects(id),
  inviter_id uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
  invitee_id uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
  role collaboration_role_type,
  secondary_roles collaboration_role_type[], -- Multiple role support
  royalty_split decimal(5,2),
  message text,
  status invitation_status,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Permission Hook System
```typescript
// Core permission checking
const { permissions, isOwner } = useProjectPermissions(projectId, userId)
const { userRole, getAllRoleNames } = useRoleBasedUI(projectId, userId)

// Permission gates for UI components
<PermissionGate projectId={projectId} userId={userId} requiredPermission="write">
  <EditButton />
</PermissionGate>
