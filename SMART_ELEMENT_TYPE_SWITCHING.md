# Smart Sidebar Element Type Change

## Issue
When clicking sidebar element buttons (Character, Parenthetical, Transition, etc.):
- ‚ùå Always added a new element at the end
- ‚ùå Couldn't change the type of an existing element
- ‚ùå Had to manually delete and recreate elements to change their type
- ‚úÖ Tab key worked to cycle types, but only in sequence

## User Story
**Scenario:** User has a CHARACTER element with text, wants to change it to PARENTHETICAL
**Before:** Had to create new element, copy text, delete old element
**After:** Click on the element, then click "Parenthetical" button - type changes instantly!

## Solution
Implemented **smart element type switching**:

### Behavior 1: Focused Element
**When a textarea is focused:**
- Clicking a sidebar button **changes the type** of the focused element
- Content is preserved
- Focus remains on the element
- User can immediately see the formatting change

### Behavior 2: No Focus
**When no element is focused:**
- Clicking a sidebar button **adds a new element** at the end
- New element is auto-focused
- User can immediately start typing

## Implementation Details

### 1. Track Focused Element
Added state to track which element is currently focused:
```tsx
const [focusedElementIndex, setFocusedElementIndex] = useState<number | null>(null)
```

### 2. Update on Focus/Blur
Added event handlers to textareas:
```tsx
onFocus={() => setFocusedElementIndex(index)}
onBlur={() => setFocusedElementIndex(null)}
```

### 3. Smart addElement Function
Modified to check for focused element:
```tsx
const addElement = useCallback((type: ElementType) => {
  if (focusedElementIndex !== null && elements[focusedElementIndex]) {
    // Change type of focused element
    const newElements = [...elements]
    newElements[focusedElementIndex].type = type
    setElements(newElements)
    // Keep focus
  } else {
    // Add new element at end
    const newElement = { id: generateId(), type, content: '' }
    setElements(prev => [...prev, newElement])
    // Auto-focus new element
  }
}, [focusedElementIndex, elements])
```

## User Experience

### Changing Element Type
1. **Click on any existing element** (e.g., "CHARACTER" with some text)
2. **Element gets focus** - cursor appears
3. **Click sidebar button** (e.g., "Parenthetical")
4. **Type changes instantly** - text preserved, formatting changes
5. **Focus stays on element** - continue editing immediately

### Adding New Element
1. **Click anywhere outside elements** (or after last element)
2. **No element is focused**
3. **Click sidebar button** (e.g., "Dialogue")
4. **New element appears** at the end
5. **Cursor appears** in new element automatically

## Element Types Affected
All sidebar buttons work with smart switching:
- üé¨ **Scene Heading** - INT./EXT. LOCATION - DAY/NIGHT
- üìù **Action** - Scene description, action lines
- üë§ **Character** - Character name (centered, uppercase)
- üí¨ **Dialogue** - Character speech (centered)
- ‚ö™ **Parenthetical** - (wryly), (under breath), etc.
- ‚û°Ô∏è **Transition** - CUT TO:, FADE IN:, etc.

## Keyboard Shortcuts Still Work
- **Tab** - Cycle to next element type
- **Shift+Tab** - Cycle to previous element type
- **Enter** - Create new element (type depends on current)
- **Ctrl+S** - Save screenplay

## Files Modified
- `src/components/screenplay-editor.tsx`

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Change Existing Element
1. Type "JOHN" in a CHARACTER element
2. Keep cursor in that element (focused)
3. Click "Parenthetical" in sidebar
4. ‚úÖ Verify element changes to parenthetical format
5. ‚úÖ Verify "JOHN" text is preserved
6. ‚úÖ Verify cursor stays in element

### Test 2: Add New Element
1. Click somewhere outside all elements (blur focus)
2. Click "Dialogue" in sidebar
3. ‚úÖ Verify new dialogue element appears at end
4. ‚úÖ Verify cursor is in new element
5. ‚úÖ Verify can immediately type

### Test 3: Change Then Type
1. Focus on element with text
2. Click different type button
3. ‚úÖ Verify type changes
4. Start typing
5. ‚úÖ Verify text is added/modified correctly

### Test 4: Empty Element Change
1. Focus on empty CHARACTER element
2. Click "Action" button
3. ‚úÖ Verify changes to Action
4. Type some text
5. ‚úÖ Verify formatting is correct
