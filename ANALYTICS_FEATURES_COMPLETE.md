# Species Analytics Features - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Analytics functionality for the Species Panel has been fully implemented with comprehensive features across two main tabs: **Statistics** and **Analysis**.

### 2. **Climate Distribution Visualization**
- **Visual Progress Bars**: Each climate zone shows allocated population as a percentage
- **Color-coded Gradients**: Purple-to-pink gradient bars for visual appeal
- **Detailed Stats**: Shows both absolute numbers and percentages per climate
- **Summary Dashboard**: 
  - Total population
  - Allocated population
  - Coverage percentage
- **Supported Climate Zones**:
  - Tropical
  - Arid
  - Temperate
  - Cold
  - Polar
  - Mountain
  - Coastal
  - Underground

### 3. **Population Demographics**
- **Age Distribution**:
  - Young (0-20% of lifespan)
  - Adult (20-80% of lifespan)
  - Elder (80-100% of lifespan)
  - Adjustable percentages with visual bars
  - Color-coded: Green (Young), Blue (Adult), Purple (Elder)

- **Gender Ratio**:
  - Male percentage
  - Female percentage
  - Other/Non-binary percentage
  - Interactive sliders with instant visual feedback
  - Color-coded: Blue (Male), Pink (Female), Purple (Other)

### 4. **Growth Rate & Projections**
- **Annual Growth Rate Input**: Set positive or negative growth percentage
- **Reproduction Rate Selector**:
  - Very Low (1-2 offspring)
  - Low (2-4 offspring)
  - Moderate (4-8 offspring)
  - High (8-15 offspring)
  - Very High (15+ offspring)

- **Population Projections**:
  - Automatic calculations for 5, 10, and 20 years
  - Shows projected population numbers
  - Displays growth/decline percentage
  - Based on compound growth rate formula
  - Visual cards with gradient backgrounds

## Analysis Tab

### 1. **Species Comparison**
- **Comparison Selector**: Choose another species from your project to compare
- **Similarity Matrix**:
  - **Physical Type Match**: Compares species types (humanoid, beast, dragon, etc.)
  - **Habitat Overlap**: Calculates percentage of shared habitats
  - **Diet Compatibility**: Compares dietary requirements
  - **Intelligence Similarity**: Measures cognitive capability differences
  - **Overall Similarity Score**: Weighted average of all factors

- **Detailed Comparison Table**:
  - Side-by-side attribute comparison
  - Shows: Type, Diet, Intelligence, Lifespan, Population
  - Clean, readable table format
  - Hover effects for better UX

### 2. **Ecosystem Impact Analysis**
- **Three Impact Categories**:
  
  **Population Impact** (0-100):
  - Based on total population size
  - Scale: Larger populations = higher impact
  - Visual progress bar with blue-indigo gradient

  **Food Web Impact** (0-100):
  - Calculated from predator and prey relationships
  - Measures species' role in the food chain
  - Visual progress bar with red-pink gradient

  **Biodiversity Impact** (0-100):
  - Based on habitat diversity and symbiotic relationships
  - Indicates ecological niche breadth
  - Visual progress bar with green-emerald gradient

- **Overall Impact Score**:
  - Combines all three categories
  - Large, prominent display
  - Impact level classification:
    - Minimal (0-25)
    - Moderate (25-50)
    - Significant (50-75)
    - Critical (75-100)
  - Color-coded badges

### 3. **Threat & Vulnerability Assessment**
- **Conservation Status Dropdown**:
  - Least Concern
  - Near Threatened
  - Vulnerable
  - Endangered
  - Critically Endangered
  - Extinct in the Wild
  - Extinct

- **Vulnerability Score**: 0-100 numerical input

- **Primary Threats Checklist**:
  - Habitat Loss
  - Climate Change
  - Overhunting
  - Disease
  - Pollution
  - Invasive Species
  - Human Conflict
  - Limited Range
  - Multiple selections allowed

- **Risk Assessment Summary**:
  - Active threat count
  - Vulnerability percentage
  - Overall risk level (Low, Moderate, High, Critical)
  - Color-coded display based on risk
  - Dynamic badge system

### 4. **Species Relationship Network**
- **Relationship Categories**:
  - Predators (red)
  - Prey (orange)
  - Symbiotic partners (green)
  - Rivals (purple)

- **Network Statistics**:
  - Count per relationship type
  - Total connection count
  - Visual icon-based cards
  - Color-coded by relationship type

- **Network Complexity Analysis**:
  - Calculates total relationships
  - Progress bar visualization
  - Complexity classification:
    - Simple ecosystem role (<5 connections)
    - Moderate ecological integration (5-10)
    - Complex ecosystem interactions (10-15)
    - Highly interconnected keystone species (15+)

## Technical Features

### Data Persistence
- All analytics data is stored in species attributes
- Real-time updates reflect immediately in visualizations
- Uses React state management for responsive UI

### Calculations
- **Population Projections**: Uses compound growth formula: `P(t) = P₀ × (1 + r)^t`
- **Similarity Scores**: Custom algorithms comparing species attributes
- **Impact Scores**: Normalized values (0-100) based on relationship counts and population
- **Percentage Distributions**: Real-time calculation with validation

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Color-Coded Elements**: Consistent color schemes for quick recognition
- **Progress Bars**: Animated transitions for value changes
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Beautiful visual hierarchy
- **Icon System**: Lucide icons for clear visual communication
- **Tooltips & Descriptions**: Helpful text explaining each metric

### Validation & Safety
- Population caps prevent over-allocation
- Percentage inputs capped at 100%
- Negative growth rates supported for declining populations
- Empty state handling with informative messages
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with Statistics**: Set your total population first, then distribute across climates
2. **Use Demographics**: Define age and gender ratios for more realistic populations
3. **Set Growth Rates**: Positive for expanding species, negative for declining ones
4. **Compare Species**: Use the Analysis tab to compare similar species
5. **Track Threats**: Keep conservation status updated based on your story's timeline
6. **Build Relationships**: Add predators, prey, and symbiotic partners in the Relations tab
7. **Monitor Impact**: Check ecosystem impact scores to balance your world's ecology
