# Arc View Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

Based on the screenshot provided, the following display issues have been resolved:

### 1. 🔧 **Character Display Issues**
**Problem:** Characters were showing generic IDs like "Character 355562d"
**Solution:** 
- ✅ Now shows actual character names or "Unnamed Character" if no name exists
- ✅ Added fallback handling for missing character data
- ✅ Shows descriptive badges with character roles and attributes
- ✅ Displays "Character Not Found" message for invalid/deleted character IDs
- ✅ Added ID badges when character name is missing for debugging

### 2. 🗺️ **Location Display Improvements**
**Problem:** Locations only showed basic info like "Rusava, Pop: 600"
**Solution:**
- ✅ Enhanced to show full location names or "Unnamed Location"
- ✅ Better display of location attributes (type, climate, population, significance, features)
- ✅ Added "Location Not Found" handling for missing locations
- ✅ Improved description display with fallback messages
- ✅ Added ID badges for debugging missing location names

### 3. 📖 **Chapter Display Problems**
**Problem:** Chapters were showing HTML content like `<span id="docs-internal-guid-...>`
**Solution:**
- ✅ **HTML Content Cleaning**: Strips all HTML tags from chapter content previews
- ✅ **Proper Titles**: Shows actual chapter titles or "Chapter [Number]" fallback
- ✅ **Clean Word Count**: Calculates word count from cleaned text (no HTML)
- ✅ **Better Previews**: Shows first 150 characters of clean text content
- ✅ **Missing Chapter Handling**: Shows "Chapter Not Found" for invalid chapter IDs
- ✅ **Enhanced Metadata**: Shows creation/update dates and proper chapter numbering

## 🚀 **New Features Added**

### Smart Error Handling
- **Missing Records**: Clear indicators when characters, locations, or chapters can't be found

- **Fallback Content**: Meaningful messages instead of broken displays

### Enhanced Information Display
- **Character Cards**: Name, role, description, age, occupation, personality traits

### Visual Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
